When I finally able to compile a random project's source code, I will type the steps and the experiences here. Compiling other's source code is a fucking inconvenience. Especially an open source project where no prebuilt binaries available, and no compilation steps available, forcing the user to read hundred of pages manual, only to find no thing but a bunch of technical stuff that probably could only be comprehended by a professor. Any way, that's it.
